<h1 id="section">起因：</h1>
<p>在找工作的半年里，我逐渐意识到每天写工程的代码对于我的算法快速实现的能力还是多多少少有些负面影响，于是为了保持coding的手速和注意力，我偶尔会在网上刷一些算法比赛。尽管在找工作之初就对Booking的Data Scientist职位很非常有好感，但是立刻就因为没有正式工作经历被拒了数次，于是也没有抱太大希望。今年2月在Hackerrank上看到Booking的算法比赛，并且有机会拿到一件Tshirt，就决定试一试。

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2016/03/27/theoretical-view-of-regularization/" itemprop="url">Theoretical View of Regularization</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Around two weeks ago, I attended a job interview, which is ML-related. During the interview, I was asked to explain SVM and regulizers. When I said the classical SVM didn’t involve empirical risk term in its objective functions, the interviewer was shocked. This experience inspired me to write this blog to summarize the some of the aspects of regularization techniques.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-regularizaiton">Introduction to regularizaiton</h1>
<p>In many introduction courses of machine learning, it’s always referred that regularization terms are considered in order to avoid overfitting problem. The most common way is to write objective function as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> f(\theta) = R_{emp}(X, \theta) + R_{structural}(\theta) </script>

<p>Intuitively, the risk (or called “error”) of a model come from two parts, the empirical risk is a measure of how different is the behaviours of the parameters and real data set, the structural risk is caused by the model itself. The structural risk is relatively difficult to understand. It’s mainly due to the high capability of the model. The capability or so called complexity is the main topic of <em>statistical learning theory</em>. Roughly speaking, <strong>we don’t want our model to be too capable</strong>, or not fit the current data-set very well. The reason can be explained from two aspects: </p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Deviation of the training-set and real data distribution</em>. Because of the limited size of training set, we can not find any possible data point from hypothesis space in the training set. More specificly, if the estimated parameters are too complex, the unlabeled data points (maybe in the test-set) may differ much from its real output. </li>
  <li><em>Existing noise in data-set</em>. Data are not always clean, the existances noise and outliers requires the model not to fit noisy data very well.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the measures of empirical risk and structural risk are independent, we often use a trade-off parameter to combine them together as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \hat{\theta} = argmin_{\theta} R_{emp}(X, \theta) + C \cdot R_{structural}(\theta) </script>

<h1 id="svm-as-regularizer">SVM as Regularizer</h1>

<p>In most practical machine learning books, SVM is described as a very common classifier. Even everyone can write down the objective function as a combination of the two risks. But only a few people know how it comes to the current form.</p>

<p>As we talked in the last paragrah, regulizer aims to reduce high complexity of the model (we will discuss the <em>complexity</em> later on). Usually the regularizer term is auxiliary in the objective function. But for SVM, regularizer is the only term that matters. The empirical risk term is dispensable to deal with noise.</p>

<p>The origion SVM didn’t take noise into account, the only goal was to maximize the distance of  two parallel hyper-planes. As we know, if they are separable, the hyperplane definitely exist, so the empirical loss is 0. The only goal is to minimize the structural risk under the restriction that each training sample is correctly classified. In terms of <strong>Structural Risk Minimization</strong>, you can refer to <a href="http://www.svms.org/srm/">SRM</a>. The original goal to maximize the distance between $y=w^Tx + b + 1$ and $y=w^Tx + b - 1$ under the restriction that every point is correctly classified is formulated as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \min_w w^T w </script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
 \begin{align*}
\text{subject to:} & (w^Tx_i+b+1)y_i \ge 0 \quad & \forall i: positive\\
& (w^Tx_i+b-1)y_i \ge 0 \quad & \forall i: negative
\end{align*} %]]></script>

<p>In order to tolerate noises, we add empirical terms to allow some points to appear between hyperplanes.</p>

<h1 id="choice-of-regularizer">Choice of Regularizer</h1>

<p>In many examples explaining <em>underfit</em>, <em>fit</em>, <em>overfit</em> we have seen how regularizer helps solve a optimal regression problem. But for classification problems, there are no general principle in terms of definition of regularization terms. For the existing regularization terms, we seldom see how each theoretically minimize the structural risk. For example, the objective function of decision tree problem involves the regularizer as the number of nodes in the tree, the more are the nodes $n$, the large is the penality. Obviously there are more alternatives. We can also use $e^n$. For both cases, we can find out a suitable trade-off parameter $C$ to balance the two risks. But ideally, which means all error come from noise, the best $C$ is independent on the traning set. However, the best $C$ must be different if we change the penality from $n$ to $e^n$. </p>

<p>The next question is whether there is alternative to combine the two risks instead of the summarization. Maybe product?</p>

<p>But the most annoying question is $L_1$ or $ L_2 $. In most cases we use $L_2$ to penalize outliers, but why we use $L_1$ in SVM to tolerate noise?</p>

<p>The answer to the previous questions can be concluded that <strong>it’s not necessary to be theoretically accurate</strong>. Machine learning is an engineering anyway.</p>

<h1 id="overfitting">Overfitting?</h1>

<p>A question that I have been ever asked is like “If you see overfitting with the current parameters, how to change your trade-off parameter”. I was therefore confused: is overfitting observable? Ideally it is definitely right theoretically if the objective function with respect to complexity of the model is convex. The convexity implies, there is a optimal complexity that minimizes the global error. Practically it’s sometimes wrong. To take SVM as an example, if we see higher test error rate than training error rate, there may be due to the overfitting. Now if we reduce the value of $C$ (reduce the weight of the tolerance), the distance between the two hyperplanes would absolutely be increased. But how about the discriminate boundary? It all depends on the distribution of the noises around the hyperplanes. Therefore, whether the generality of the model increases is still unknown. </p>

<h1 id="modern-regularizer">Modern Regularizer</h1>

<h1 id="dropout">Dropout</h1>
<p>In the most of traditional statistical models, regulizer normally acts as an additional term in the objective function. But in order to tacle the side effect of the most popular and effective learning machine – Deep Neural Networks, new kinds of regularizer should be proposed. As mentioned in the paper [1], the most popular regulizer <em>Dropout</em>, is a variation of model averaging. Comparing to averaging serveral independent neural networks, Dropout is much easier to implement. Due the the popularity of Dropout, we don’t need to explain it in details.</p>

<h1 id="l2-normalization">L2 normalization</h1>
<p>One of the simplest way to apply L2 constraint is adding penalty as the L2 norm of the weight vectors at each layer, but instead, the second strategy is limiting the upper bound of the L2 norm of the weight vector of each layer. Each time when the constraint is violated, the vector is re-normalized.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The first formal contact to the concept “expressive” is in the course “Fondation of Data Science”, after that I prefer to use the words “Computational Power” to understand it, because at that time, I was more familiar with computational models, such as automata, turing machines, first-order logic etc. Also it measures the models from the perspective of computational functions. But later I found the phrase “computational power” is the word and somewhat ambiguous, so I gave up this saying. Due to the fact that, the models I was familiar with are mostly for the determination, that is, to accept one input and only returns a “yes” or “no” model, so for the “expressiveness” is more appropriate. Let’s look at a example of natural language: “I am a smart and friendly person”, this sentence can be used to judge the authenticity of the right, if the “and” and similar expressions deleted from natural language, then there is no way to express this sentence, or that the original expression expressiveness weaker than the latter, so that the theory used to explain the “expressiveness” of the concept is more reasonable.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, this translation “computing capabilities” is ambiguous because it’s similar to “computability”, but there are big differences from their definitions. “Computability” is a set of classes can be calculated using a turing machine or its equivalent models, the answer to this question is only “yes” or “no.” So computability is a judgement which takes turing machines as a tool. However expressiveness is more likely to be a contionous measurement.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Almost every student, who studies computer science at an early age are exposed to “algorithm” concept, but everyone often regards “algorithm” to solve a specific problem in a sequence of operations. The “operations” are always in the term can be described as several consecutive nested steps, and finally can be converted into a command-style code, including sequential, looping, selecting  structures.</p>

<p>After exposure to functional programming, the “algorithm” has become a broader understanding. Functional programming algorithm is more like a direct description of the problem itself, rather than one by one step. For example, in Haskell algorithm to achieve quick sort, ideas and details is much simpler than imperative programming: in each step, filter out the elements that are larger and smaller than as the standard, send them to the recursion, and concate their results. Because of this characteristic of functional programming, when many people introduce functional programming, they always referred to “learn functional programming without learning algorithm because functional programming itself is the description of the problem.” After I was taking the words as a goal, and finished learning the course Funcitonal Programming (and Logic Programming later), and found such a sentence has a strong misleading. Although functional programming is simply a description of the problem, but You must be in accordance with functional programming (and logic programming) in their own way to achieve this. There is a problem which relates to “conversion cost”, for many algorithms which are able to be achieved within 10 lines of code, may cost a very long time and code to be translated into functional programs. On the other hand the advantage of the “algorithm” is that they can optimize the performance, that is, as long as you learn algorithm very well, any programs can be completed within a short enough time to run.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This is a course from last semester, to advantage of the holidays, I’ll write a short summary. Although it doesn’t revolutionize my world view like computability theory and mathematical logic, but as a relatively basic theoretical course, it did inspire me a lot.</p>

<p>I choose the course at the beginning, partly because it is the offered by mathematical logic institut, partly because the name seems bluffing. Because any discrete problems once placed under the assumption of “infinite”, it will become much more difficult, most of the solutions for the “infinite” problem becomes less applicable. For example, determining a complementary set of a regular language is trivial. But to construct the complementary set of infite regular language becomes sophiscated.</p>

<p>The relationship between “finite” and “infinite” is not only opposite. In some scenarios, they are equivalent. completeness theorem of propositional logic, which is to build the equivalence of infinite set to an arbitrary finite set for determination, so that the unsolvable problem becomes solvable. </p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have said many times before, computational theory is the root of computer science, it is also the reason of the difference between mathematics and computer science. On the border of computer science and mathematics, the one side of computer science is computational theory, the other side of mathematics is mathematical logic.</p>

<p>Computational theory mostly focused on very specific issues - the “generality”, without any conditionality, some questions are whether or not computable. Two of most common examples are the halting problem and equivalence problem: Is there a mechanical method can accurately determine whetehr an function can stop and it is determined whether two turing machines are equivalent (“equivalent” is, whether they are  calculating the same function). The answer and proof of the first question can be found anywhere: undecidable. The second question is more difficult to determine, strictly speaking, we should construct a reduction: $H \leq Eq$. An easy way to understand it is that to say the turing machines calculating the same function, we must enumerate all possible inputs, and determines whether the output is the same or not, however the input set is infinite, so the process does not stop. Since the determining process of the previous two questions by our brains is somehow heuristic, which implies, the strategy is not possible to apply to turing machines, and can not strictly concluded as mechanical process. </p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In this semester, there was course called “Foundation of Data Science”, which is in terms of database but pretends to be related to “Data Science”. The reason for my difficulty understanding it is probably that some prerequisite I never learned before.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many of the views in the course are worth learning and thinking. Looking back to the courses in my bachelors, which contains Compiler Theory, Database Theory, Computer Network, Operating Systems. As I know, the top universities in america are trying to weaken the connection between different domains. Of course it has benefits in some respects. However from the point of an abstract and theoretical view, it does not help the students understand the essential question.</p>

		<p>这篇没有涉及具体的理论知识，主要是建立在部分相关经历之上的一些臆想，所以多少会有些民科思维。的确，我在这方面的经验少的可怜。但是相比于能看到我博客的人来说，信息不对称还是非常严重的。从刚入学我就多次表达了我的震惊。我发现计算机科学还有这么大一片领域我几乎一无所知，最可怕的是，我所谓的一些“基础和见识”可能也就是当地大二学生的水平。经过了一个暑假的沉淀和反思，我对于形式理论的极端态度渐渐冷却，所以，我也希望我能把它放到和其他领域平等的地位上考虑一些它们之间的关系。</p>
