	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">Expressiveness</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The first formal contact to the concept “expressive” is in the course “Fondation of Data Science”, after that I prefer to use the words “Computational Power” to understand it, because at that time, I was more familiar with computational models, such as automata, turing machines, first-order logic etc. Also it measures the models from the perspective of computational functions. But later I found the phrase “computational power” is the word and somewhat ambiguous, so I gave up this saying. Due to the fact that, the models I was familiar with are mostly for the determination, that is, to accept one input and only returns a “yes” or “no” model, so for the “expressiveness” is more appropriate. Let’s look at a example of natural language: “I am a smart and friendly person”, this sentence can be used to judge the authenticity of the right, if the “and” and similar expressions deleted from natural language, then there is no way to express this sentence, or that the original expression expressiveness weaker than the latter, so that the theory used to explain the “expressiveness” of the concept is more reasonable.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, this translation “computing capabilities” is ambiguous because it’s similar to “computability”, but there are big differences from their definitions. “Computability” is a set of classes can be calculated using a turing machine or its equivalent models, the answer to this question is only “yes” or “no.” So computability is a judgement which takes turing machines as a tool. However expressiveness is more likely to be a contionous measurement.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Also another thing that is worth mentioning is the decision problem. All computable functions can be converted to its corresponding indicator function. For example, $f(x) = y$ can be converted into $F(x, y) = 1$. And we say “expressiveness”, while we are really talking about the “expressiveness” of an indicator function. This is why, I compared automata, first-order logic, which can only return true and false, with turing machines, which seems more flexible. All these models are comparable if we only consider their equivalent indicator functions.</p>

<p>From this point of view, we can answer a question, why the automata are often used as the simplest model in compiler theory of syntax analysis, or for regular expressions, however they act as a research field of theoretical computer science.</p>

<h1 id="automaton-and-turing-machine">Automaton and Turing Machine</h1>

<p>I have ever answered the two questions at Zhihu: “Can an automaton have infinite states?” And “The most important component to a turing machine is the state transition table, is the unlimited tape also necessary?.”</p>

<p>First of all, in terms of the historical development, automaton was developed earlier than the turing machines, but now even nobody pays attention to the automata, which has a simpler structure than a turing machine. Instead, Turing machine was proposed as the beginning of computer science. The reason is, because turing machine is the first implementation of “mechanical movement” of first logic, and the automaton though more a simple and easier simulation, but can only represent limited ability, compared to turing machine, or to say the automaton is weaker than Turing machines.</p>

<p>In fact, the two issues mentioned above are essentially the same, we took the latter as an example to explain from the ability to express it:</p>

<p>First turing machines and automaton actually from operations is essentially the same: According to the current state and determine the transition rules, only transformed into another state. The difference is that state machine is a clear definition of the state, and the state of the turing machine is “Configuration”: (tape contents, the pointer position, status). Suppose the turing machines only have finte tapes, then the possibility of tape and the pointer positions are limited, also for the definition of turing machine, the states is limited as well, so for every turing machine’s configuration, we can construct an automaton such that, the number of states of the automaton is finte, and behaves equivalent to the turing machine, so turing machine is no more expressive than automata. Furthermore, the power of turing machines lies in the infinite taps.</p>

<p>The first question to answer is relatively not trivial, because within “infinite”, it could be divided into countable, uncountable, uncountable and can continue to continue to divide. Almost have to consider each case separately, it is not so simple.</p>

<h1 id="expressiveness-and-analyzability">Expressiveness and Analyzability</h1>

<p>No matter for mathematical logic, or computer models that are usually discussed, an important conclusion is that “the stronger is the expressiveness, the weaker is the analyzability.” For example, given the facts, all expressions of first-order logic is decidable, while second-order logic is not. On the other hand, the expressions of the second-order logic are stronger than the first-order logic. This conclusion can be extended to any logical and computational models. To take formal languages as an example, the expressiveness of star-free languages is weaker than it of regular languages, and the latter is weaker than context-free languages, but thefact is star-free languages are equivalent to groups, regular languages are equivalent to semigroups. As we know, semigroups has less constraints than groups, also they are less analyzable.</p>

<p>Of course, this conclusion is true for turing machines, on the one hand, we hope to invent a model can express a wealth of ideas, on the other hand, we have to lose the contronl of the model. we even can not propose a general method to test whether a program can stop or not in theory, let alone to judge whether a program has bugs.</p>

<p>It is also because of this trade-off, a lot of weaker expressive models survive and not been completely replaced in some areas.</p>

<h1 id="parametric-machine-learning-and-expressiveness">Parametric machine learning and expressiveness</h1>

<p>Here that we focus on the parametric machine learning models, which implies parameters can all be estimated from machine learning models. Nonparametric methods such as KNN are not discussed. from the point of view of whether the parameters of a machine learning problem can be learned, we can add a property: “learnability”. Such as state transition tables of automata and turing machines, which can be seen as different from the other parameters, the parameters of SVM is the dividing plane of $w$ and $b$, the parameters of a decision tree is the sequence of rules, and so on. Can these parameters be learnt? Obviously, if it is, we seem to see an foundamental problem of machine learning - learning a turing machine. As the theoretical model with the strongest expressiveness, if the argument turing machine can be learned by some algorithms, and intelligent thinking can be represented by an arbitrary computable function, then it seems to have arrived at the end of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>However, even if we simplify the problem down to a certain terminating turing machine, the problem is still unsolvable. In order to explain, of course, we must first define a reasonable “learnability”, we define it with the criteria PAC-learnable. For any small error $ \delta &gt; 0 $, we can find out a training set size $ N $ such that For any sample set with greater than $ N $ samples, we can garantee that the error is less than $ \delta $ parameters. However, for one of the most classic PAC unlearnable problem: a countable set on a finite number of points can be expressed as a discriminant function of a turing machine. It implies, this class of turing machines are not learnable. As a result, It seems this idea from the most basic level is unachievable.</p>

<h1 id="the-expressiveness-of-deep-learning">The expressiveness of deep learning</h1>

<p>Previous articles have mentioned some of the theoretical reasons of success of deep learning, but did not discussed very specificly. Here again we talk slightly in terms of expressiveness of deep learning.</p>

<p>In the seminar depth learning in last semester, I chose the topic “Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks”, which is regarded as one of the largest estimate subject, because two topics can be easily extented to a series of sub-problems, and finally the result is that I didn’t catch the professor’s interest points. At the end of the slides, I was asked to present the relationship between the two neural networks from any perspectives, even though they are not really linked to each other. Finally I chose the option: the ability to express. That is, with the same structures (the same number of layers and the same number of neurons, connections are not necessarily the same), RNN, ordinary DNN and CNN, have the expresiveness RNN &gt; DNN &gt; CNN. This conclusion is very obvious, because they are decreasing with the number of parameters, and the parameters of the latter is is a subset of the former. However this conclusion obviously does not make sense, but to introduce more machine learning model as comparisons, we may have a new understanding. </p>

<p>To take SVM as an example for comparison on image recognition, before Deep Learning became ad-hoc in 2006, SVM + kernel was an efficient and sophisticated methods for a very long time in many areas. All high-dimensional classification problems can be mapped to a linear seperation problem if there is a suitable kernel method. However, this conclusion is not totally correct, in “<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/PBR_chapter.pdf">On the challenge of learning complex functions</a>” of Y. Bengio, it mentions the kernel as machine learning almost the most common method has limitations in the simulation of complex structured functions. From this perspective, the non-linear kernel as the surface is mapped to an arbitrary dividing hyperplane method from the expressiveness is not perfect. From another side, it also explained the underlying reason of the success of deep learning - traditional models can not have the expressiveness.</p>

<p>Go back to the two common deep neural networks RNN and CNN, we can say they are enhancing their expressiveness from different ways. The reason differs with the specific issues, such as CNN is extracting local feature hierachically, RNN is handling time-dependence.</p>

<p>Although the enhanced expressiveness of is the trend, but not true for any cases. In machine learning, standing on its opposite position is generalization. In particular, for training of 100 samples, we use a 10-layer neural network is clearly inappropriate, the resulting parameters are very likely to be over-fitting, the reason is the inbalance between the number of samples and parameters. It also explains why in early years when number of samples is limited, neural networks didn’t perform very well.</p>

<p>After all, the big trend is the development of expressiveness. But the issues which really bothered academia and industry are often beyond the expressiveness, such as generalization problems, and lack of adequate data.</p>

<p>As neural networks ability to express the most interesting question - neural turing machines, we will discuss in detailes in the future.</p>
