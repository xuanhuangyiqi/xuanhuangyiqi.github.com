	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">Standard Form of Algorithmic Problems</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Almost every student, who studies computer science at an early age are exposed to “algorithm” concept, but everyone often regards “algorithm” to solve a specific problem in a sequence of operations. The “operations” are always in the term can be described as several consecutive nested steps, and finally can be converted into a command-style code, including sequential, looping, selecting  structures.</p>

<p>After exposure to functional programming, the “algorithm” has become a broader understanding. Functional programming algorithm is more like a direct description of the problem itself, rather than one by one step. For example, in Haskell algorithm to achieve quick sort, ideas and details is much simpler than imperative programming: in each step, filter out the elements that are larger and smaller than as the standard, send them to the recursion, and concate their results. Because of this characteristic of functional programming, when many people introduce functional programming, they always referred to “learn functional programming without learning algorithm because functional programming itself is the description of the problem.” After I was taking the words as a goal, and finished learning the course Funcitonal Programming (and Logic Programming later), and found such a sentence has a strong misleading. Although functional programming is simply a description of the problem, but You must be in accordance with functional programming (and logic programming) in their own way to achieve this. There is a problem which relates to “conversion cost”, for many algorithms which are able to be achieved within 10 lines of code, may cost a very long time and code to be translated into functional programs. On the other hand the advantage of the “algorithm” is that they can optimize the performance, that is, as long as you learn algorithm very well, any programs can be completed within a short enough time to run.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>To come back to our topic – That is how to treat almost the most important concept of computer science - algorithm. Although the way of understanding “algorithm” in the previous statement is nothing wrong, but as an important part of science, algorithm seems too fragmented, it has no structure, framework. Such as the same called algorithms, for machine learning learning algorithms (such as EM) and  shortest path algorithm in graph theory, there is no way to find a general form simultaneously to summarize them. Another more specific example is the algorithms in ACM/ICPC contest, from junior high school students to the programmers, they more or less contact with some books or online tutorials to introducing algorithm contests. The most common point is they are divided into several sections: a section roughly speaking about greedy method; a section about graph algorithms; and a section about dynamic programming, and so on. But in fact there is no link between the chapters, the only clue can link them is - they are easy to study even without any research background, and flexible computer algorithms. Or that they are simple algorithms in computer science projected to the dimension “complexity to study” , and then classified by subjects. If the student only learn algorithms from this perspective is clearly one-sided.</p>

<p>Back to the question itself, which when I was thinking in the course of optimization, is there a way to unite all the algorithms in the general sense? Of course. In machine learning the concept is called “objective function”, in continuous optimization it’s called the standard form .</p>

<p>From a more general point, for all deterministic algorithm, or algorithms, called a clear objective, can be divided into the “optimization of certain functions”, and “check the the feasible solutions”. Then they can be again united, the result is that all deterministic algorithms can be described in a standard form of optimization problems to indicate that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \min_x f(x) </script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[

\begin{align*}
    \text{subject to:} &g_i(x) \le 0 \\
    &h_j(x) = 0
\end{align*}
 %]]></script>

<p>More generally，we ignore $h_j(x)$, the problems of finding feasiable solutions can  be described as standard forms without $f(x)$.
While $x$ is the input，$f$ is the to be optimized function. To take backpack problem as an example:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \min_x \sum x_i w_i </script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \text{subject to:} \sum x_i v_i - V \le 0 </script>

<p>x_i equals 0 or 1, indicates being chosen or not. After thinking again, we find there is still another problem: the domain $x_i$ only contains 0 and 1, which is not observed in the standard form, it will lead to a more complex problems - integer programming. It’s too complicated to be explained in this ariticle. </p>

<p>Another example of optimization algorhtim to solve problems in standard form that I can think of is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69644/tr-98-14.pdf">SMO(Sequential Minimal Optimization)</a> algorithm, The people who have already studied SVM(Support Vector Machine), knows that, the goal of SVM is maximizing the distance between paralleled straigt lines，Then with the help of Lagrange Duality we can transfer the problem to solving the support vectors，the basic idea of SMO is iteratively select $a_i$ $a_j$ under the constraints to minimize the objective funciton，until the vector $a$ approaximates to the optimal.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \min_a \Phi(a) = \min_a {1 \over 2} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N y_i y_j (x_i \cdot x_j) a_i a_j - \sum_{i=1}^N a_i </script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[

\begin{align*}
  \text{subject to: } & a_i \ge 0 \\
  & \sum_{i=1}^N y_i a_i = 0
\end{align*}
 %]]></script>

<p>From the point of view of Optimization to understand algorithms is that every problem to be solved by algorithms can be described in a standard form, which in fact, in some universities, the matimatical students study algorithms from the lecture “algorithms” with computer science students, but from the course “discreate optimization”, which both covers algorithms and computability and complexity theory. </p>
